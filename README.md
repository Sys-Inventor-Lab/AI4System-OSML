# OSML/OSML+
OSML is an ML-based scheduler that intelligently schedules multiple interactive resources to meet co-located services' QoS targets. OSML employs multiple ML models to work collaboratively to predict QoS variations, shepherd the scheduling, and recover from QoS violations in complicated co-location cases.

OSML+ is the extension of OSML+. The additional features of OSML+ over OSML include: (1) OSML+ has new ML models with a shorter scheduling time interval, making OSML+ converge faster. (2) We use transfer learning technology to make OSML+ work well on new platforms. (3) We design a new central control framework in OSML+ that handles complicated co-location cases including LC and BE services. 

OSML/OSML+ can generalize across platforms. We provide OSML and OSML+'s implementation, data set, and ML models on the following platforms.

2. **OSML+ on a server equipped with an Intel Xeon E5-2697 v4 CPU**
    - We have collected extensive traces on this platform. ML models can be trained and generalized based on these data and then used on new platforms with low-overhead transfer learning. The ML models on this platform were trained directly using these traces without transfer learning.

3. **OSML+ on a server equipped with an Intel Xeon Gold 6338 CPU**
    - OSML+ can be generalized to new platforms using transfer learning. We collect traces for only a few hours on this platform. The ML models are trained using transfer learning based on pre-trained models from [the server with Intel Xeon E5 2697 v4](https://github.com/Sys-Inventor-Lab/AI4System-OSML/blob/master/OSML+_on_server_with_Intel_Xeon_E5_2697_v4). The ML models perform well on the new platform.
