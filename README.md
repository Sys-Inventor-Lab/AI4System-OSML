# AI4System-OSML

OSML is the product of a research project funded by a top-tier cloud provider. The final due of this project will be in July 2023. Based on the contract, we are legally banned from releasing its source code until the end of this project. Currently, we are actively working on the final stages for open sourcing the project. Our team is conducting code reviews to ensure that the project meets high-quality standards. We will open source OSML soon in August 2023.
